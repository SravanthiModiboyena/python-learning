# we need classes just to avoid repetition and organize code neatly.

# Basic Structure of class : class ClassName: #variables, methods
# object is an instance of a class 

class Student:
    name="Sam"
    age=9
s1=Student()
print(s1.age)
print(s1.name)

# s1 is a object 
# name, age attributes 
# Student() constructor call
